<h2>
Customer's phone won't scan at the entrance or exit</h2>
<p>
Most phones are set to automatically dim the screen in low light conditions.&nbsp; This makes it easy on your eyes and saves battery life but it&#39;s hard to read&nbsp;reflective surfaces with dim screens.&nbsp; If&nbsp;the scanner&nbsp;can&#39;t read 
the QR code, ask the member to please turn up the brightness.</p>
